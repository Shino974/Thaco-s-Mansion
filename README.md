- ## Usage
You can move around with the arrow keys ou Z, Q, S, D.
You are an investigator and have been deployed to find out what happened in the Thaco family mansion.
As you visit, you'll find remnants of a diary scattered throughout the mansion. 
Your aim is to retrieve all the pages and escape to make your report. 
There are no enemies in the game, but you'll need the atmosphere to scare you off
